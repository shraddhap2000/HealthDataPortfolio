Ambulatory Care Utilization & Chronic Disease Burden Analysis
Executive Summary
Analyzed ambulatory visit patterns and chronic disease burden across multiple health centers to identify high-demand locations, high-need patient groups, and operational pressure points. Insights support better staffing, scheduling, and chronic care program planning.

Business Problem
Leadership lacked a clear view of:
•	Which centers handle the highest volume of visits
•	Where chronic disease patients are concentrated
•	Which patients generate the most chronic-related encounters
Without this visibility, staffing decisions, resource allocation, and patient management programs cannot be targeted effectively.
Goal: Provide data-driven clarity to support operational and clinical decision-making.

Methodology
Data Preparation (SQL – SSMS)
•	Used CTEs to organize query logic
•	Performed JOINS across encounters, patients, and centers
•	Used aggregate functions to summarize total visits and chronic disease counts
•	Applied CASE logic to classify chronic vs non-chronic encounters
•	Exported cleaned results to Excel
Analysis & Visualization (Excel / Tableau)
•	Performed final data checks and formatting
•	Built calculated fields for chronic burden ratios
•	Applied Top 10 filters for prioritization
•	Developed clear bar chart visuals for leadership review

Key Insights
1️⃣ Total Patients by Total Visits
High-volume centers show significant operational demand → candidates for additional staffing or appointment expansion.
2️⃣ Top 10 Centers by Chronic Disease Patients
A small number of centers manage the majority of chronic disease visits → priority locations for chronic care initiatives and preventive programs.
3️⃣ Top 10 Patients by Chronic Visit Burden
A small subset of patients accounts for a large share of chronic encounters → opportunities for case management, outreach, and tailored care plans.

Recommendations
•	Enhance chronic care programs at centers with the highest disease burden
•	Proactively manage high-utilization patients to reduce avoidable visits
•	Reassess staffing and scheduling capacity at high-visit centers
•	Use data-driven prioritization to target care improvement initiatives

📌 Next Steps
•	Add demographics and risk variables for deeper segmentation
•	Incorporate cost or outcome data for financial and clinical impact analysis
•	Build time-trend visualizations to monitor future utilization patterns
•	Expand metrics to include no-shows, follow-ups, and referral patterns
