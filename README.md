#About 

Hey, I'm Shraddha! I have an analytical background in Biochemistry and recently completed my Master's in Healthcare Informatics & Data Analytics, where I discovered a passion for transforming raw healthcare data into meaningful insights. I’m excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field as an entry-level professional in healthcare analytics and informatics.
