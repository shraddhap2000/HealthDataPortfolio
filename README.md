# Shraddha Patel- Portfolio 
### About 

Hey, I'm Shraddha! I have an analytical background in Biochemistry and recently completed my Master's in Healthcare Informatics & Data Analytics. I’m passionate about using data to understand patient needs, improve care processes, and support operational decision-making. As an entry-level analyst, I’m exploring opportunities across healthcare analytics, from clinical and quality analytics to operations and population health, where I can continue learning while contributing meaningful insights. I’m excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field. 

This portfolio is designed to showcase my analytical approach, problem-solving style, and interest in healthcare data. Below, you’ll find a collection of mini-projects, each with clear documentation, explanations, and insights.
